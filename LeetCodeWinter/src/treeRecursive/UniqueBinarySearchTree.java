    *  For example, F(3, 7): the number of unique BST tree with number 3 as its root.
    *  To construct an unique BST out of the entire sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] with 3 as the root,
    *  which is to say, we need to construct an unique BST out of its left subsequence [1, 2] and
    *  another BST out of the right subsequence [4, 5, 6, 7], and then combine them together (i.e. cartesian product).
    *  The tricky part is that we could consider the number of unique BST out of sequence [1,2] as G(2),
    *  and the number of of unique BST out of sequence [4, 5, 6, 7] as G(4). Therefore, F(3,7) = G(2) * G(4)
    *
    *  F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i)	1 <= i <= n
